    <h2 class="vam2">what is CSS?</h2>
    <ol class="vam3" type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheet.</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><span class="vam5" >CSS is not neccesary</span><span class="vam6">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
        <li class="vam7">External stylesheets are stored in css files.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="vam4">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="vam8">
        <li>
            Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements!
        </li>
        <li>Internal - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS files. however. <span class="vam10">In this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span>,because thid is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="vam11">when comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID is also special is that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by javascript.</p>
    <p class="vam12">in CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p class="vam13">there is a wide range of selectors avaliable. two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
